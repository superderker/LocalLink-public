# Frontend factory

Frontend directory for the project.
<br>The project is written in Javascript and utilising react-native to give it a native feeling on both Android and Apple devices.

## Formatting & naming standards

For the frontend we utilise <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode">prettier</a> to format the javascript code.

For naming standards we'll be using the `camelCase` for variables and `CamelCase` for functions. This may or may not change in specific scenarious throughout the project.
